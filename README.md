# Deep Learning for Face Recognition

As part of the OT2 course at INSA de Lyon, this Machine Learning project aims at using Deep Learning technologies in various ways. These technologies have been shown to have the best results regarding Computer Vision tasks such as Image and Video Classification, Object Detection, Image Segmentation and Face Recognition.
In this specific project, we’ll be using Deep Learning to perform Face Recognition on a large image dataset. 

The project has two sets of objectives: 

1) Implementing an end-to-end face recognition pipeline that uses convolutional neural networks, using the following steps:
    - Choosing and Preprocessing the datasets
    - Choosing the neural network architecture
    - Implementing the face detector
    - Visualizing and Evaluating results

2) Building competences around the Machine Learning and Data Science problems, some of which are the following:
    - The difficulty of extracting semantic information from images
    - The functioning of a Convolutional Neural Network, how it’s trained and applied
    - The influence of training data, of the network’s architecture and of overfitting on the final results
    - The complexity/accuracy tradeoff
    - The limitations of learning methodologies in the context of a face recognition task
